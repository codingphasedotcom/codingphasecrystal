### Welcome to the ROCKY Stack
I built this as an experiment to put together the best libraries to build a modern yet simple stack.

I chose to base my stack

 * React - Solid front end framework backed by Facebook

 * Crystal - A powerful new language with syntax similar to ruby but is as fast as "C"

 * Kemal - Super light weight http framework made by Serdar DoÄŸruyol

 * Yarn - The fastest package manager also made by Facebook
